1. PropTypes are safeguards against the wrong data-type (i.e. string, number, boolean, etc.) being used in a place where a different data-type is expected.  This can be a real hazard on very large projects, where multiple developers are involved and mistakes can propagate over many files.  PropTypes will issue a warning if they are receiving an unexpected data-type.
2. The events in a component's lifecycle are mounting, updating, and unmounting.  We use functions like componentDidMount and componentDidUnmount to define conditions or activities we only want to happen while a component is mounted to the DOM.
3. A higher-order component wraps around and existing component to transform it into a new component.  They're useful for defining in one place processes that will happen over and over.
4. CSS, Reactstrap/Bootsrap, and styled components.
