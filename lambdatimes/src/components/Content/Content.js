      Notice that we're passing this function to our <Cards /> component below.
      This function returns an array of cards, so we can just pass it down as such.

      Your algorithim for the logic here is as follows: 
        - if the selected tab is 'all' it should return all 
          of the items from cardData. 
        - else, it should only return those cards whose 'tab' matched this.state.selected.
